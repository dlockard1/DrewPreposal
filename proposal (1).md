# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

#Tic-Tac-Toe

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

#We will create the classic tic-tac-toe game where it allows for you to play with #two people.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

#Our software will set up a screen that shows a classic tic-tac-toe board. It #will then allow two users to play tic-tac-toe, one person will be x's the other #o's. Once a person wins it will put a line through the winning line and #congragulate the user on winning.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

#N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

#Nayib Rahman, tuj80582@temple.edu, Xinweng Zhang

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.





### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

#A good outcome will be at least creating a tic-tac-toe game with 2 players.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

#We think we can get it to put a line through and congradgulate the winner when someone wins.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

#The best outcome would be that we can create a user vs comp mode where you play against the computer.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

#We will need to research how to add images in python to create a tic tac toe background, we will also need to learn how to make the computer know someone won based on if they have 3 in a row. We did not split up the work yet, we will most likely think through everything together and then go frome there.
