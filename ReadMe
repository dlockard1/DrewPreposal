We ran into a few problems while making Gobblet Gobblers. One of the main ones was making it look good. 
We wanted a nicer board and for the players colors to be different. We were unable to do so in a timely manner, looking back at it we should have done our game in
a different coding language. We didn't because we felt most comfortable with Python. Another problem we were unable to fix was detecting who won the game correctly. 
After some research we could not get the code to understand the difference between player 1's pieces and player 2's pieces, so it announces a winner even if it's 
2 different players pieces.

Although we did overcome some challenges. We were unsure how to create a board in python but after some research we got a pretty normal looking board. We also had to 
research how to get the code to announce a winner even if there was 3 different sized pieces in a row. After some research we learned that we needed to use the .keys()
function. We also struggled with the move function, we were able to get it so a player can move on top, but were unable to figure out how to move off of another piece
correctly. Overall the biggest challenge we overcam was working in a pair for the first time while coding. We had to learn how to write off of eachother and use some 
comments so the other person could follow.
