Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We have created most of the game, which includes the board, piecies, how to play, and user inputs.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We have not created a "win" for the user. We also have not made the board and game look appealing yet.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We are struggling to make it look appealing. We need to do research on how to do that using python (like changing colors and effects).
